Now I got the project to improve my knowledge in my Swift studies. I got some skills in figma and created this wireframe to handle the project design into code. The concepts added here were oriented by Marcos Tanaka (iOS Developer) and my first Mentor. We got some basic features to add into the project and talk about more advanced concepts.
